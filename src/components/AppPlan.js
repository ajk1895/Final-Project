// Character organizer app



//3 pages
// Landing page explaining app giving examples-> app intended to create and organize characters into 2 factions for story writing/ttrpgs
// one page for each "faction" 

//full CRUD
//React Bootstrap

// 10 components:

//navbar
//forms to enter character info(name, backstory/description/abilities/stats, and faction)
//maybe simplfy name and story as one thing/only name if faction stuff gets too complicated(this happened real quick)
//text blocks holding info
//cards to display text blocks (didnt work out)
//list to hold cards
//landing page component(s) to explain what app is with buttons(just used navbar instead) to take you to the other pages. maybe a preview of the other 2?

//state and props are still giving me issues.  maybe related to version 18.2 syntax? most of the resources i found didnt specify 18.2, just 18 or not at all.



/**

based on which page is displayed, filter array based on boolean 
use filtered array to create cards from objects via the components that go into the card
