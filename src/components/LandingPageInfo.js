                This application is designed to organize characters based on faction alignment.
            </h6><br/>
            <p>The idea behind it is to help organize characters for a TTRPG like D and D, CyberPunk: RED, etc. <br/>
                Right now it is only designed for holding two factions, but it may be updated later to allow for more complexity
                such as more Factions and descriptions of the characters.
